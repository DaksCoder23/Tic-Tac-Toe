## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid
2. Players take turns putting their marks (X or O) in empty squares
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw
